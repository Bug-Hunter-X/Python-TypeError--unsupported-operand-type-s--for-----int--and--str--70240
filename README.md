This repository contains a demonstration of a common Python error and its solution.  The `bug.py` file shows code that attempts to calculate the average of a list containing both integers and a string. This results in a `TypeError` because the `sum()` function cannot handle strings.  The `bugSolution.py` file presents a corrected version that handles this exception.  This example illustrates the importance of input validation and robust error handling in Python programming.
